####Some of the key attractions of Defi for many consumers are:

1. It eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge for using their services.
2. You hold your money in a secure digital wallet instead of keeping it in a bank.
3. Anyone with an internet connection can use it without needing approval.
4. You can transfer funds in seconds and minutes.

Decentralized finance, or Defi, uses emerging technology to remove third parties in financial transactions.
And components of Defi are stablecoins, software, and hardware that enables the development of applications.

In this hackathon, I'm be contributing to by building a Defi tooling DApp that provides price quotes for swaps, bridges, and token transfers, by using the products and tools that have been developed by sponsors in this hackathon:
